flapmodel:

This program generates simplified pinna shapes based on an obliquely
truncated cone with a flap added.

The program reads a configuration file with the model parameters (in
plain text format) and outputs the model as an array of
black-and-white voxels (in VTK vsp file format). Optional surface mesh
output is also available in PLY, STL, and VTK-formats.

The input file format (model configuration) is documented in the file
fileformat.txt. The file parblank.txt can be used as a template for a
new configuration file. The parameters are also documented in the file
parameter.txt.

Examples of configuration files can be found in the conf-subdirectory.
