## TA Comments:
* Problem 1 (30/30)
* Problem 2.1 (10/10)
* Problem 2.2 (10/10)\
Total = 50/50

## Goals:
* Implementing Newton's method for finding zero crossing of a function.
* Implementing a factorial function that can correctly output the factorial of large integers.
    
## Files to work on:
* Work on `/src/newtonRaphson.cpp` to implement the Newton-Raphson method. We have already provided the main driver function `/mainQ1.cpp` which uses your Newton-Raphson method. You do not need to modify `/mainQ1.cpp` unless you need to debug your Newton-Raphson implementation. Compile your code successfully and run the executable `/build/hw2Q1Executable`. 
* Work on `/src/factorial.h` to first declare a correct function prototype for your factorial2 function. Implement your factorial2 function in `/src/factorial.cpp`. You **need** to work on the main driver function `/mainQ2.cpp` to create a program which will make use of your factorial function. Please read the instructions in `/mainQ2.cpp`. Compile your code successfully and run the executable `/build/hw2Q2Executable`. 

## Running tests:
* For question 1, to check whether your code passes the test cases, run `/build/hw2Tests/01_NewtonRaphsonTests/01_runHW2NewtonRaphsonTests`.
* For question 2, to check whether your code passes the test cases, run `/build/hw2Tests/02_FactorialTests/02_runHW2FactorialTests`.

## Note:
* Make sure your solution compiles and runs.
* The template code will compile but will fail the test cases.
* Make sure you push your last changes before the deadline.
* If you had any questions, post them on Slack.

Good luck!
